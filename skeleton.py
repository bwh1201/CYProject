Project Skeleton: Cow Loan Projection

Description:
The product that we wish to provide is a simulator that will allow cadets to practice their 
financial habits before they take out their Cow Loan. In this simulator, users will not only
 be able to choose what to spend their money on (car, class ring, engagement ring, etc), but
 also see what may happen to their money if they choose to put it in the stock market. During 
 their time as cadets, major events will take place that can influence what happens to their money.
 This simulator will allow Cadets to see the projected results of their financial habits 10, 20, 
 and 30 years after they receive their Cow Loan. The project will operate like a game, using the 
 pygame zero library which will help create the graphic user interface.  The game will present 
 options for portions of the cow loan and then will simulate a potential future as a result of 
 these decisions. Using pygame zero will allow images and user control over the decisions being taken and 
 increase the aesthetic of the game.  Overall, the creation of this project will be entirely 
 in python using the skills we have learned from the course.  The final product will yield an
 entertaining and informative way for cadets to maximize their cow loan. 


Things we need: clever name, image of cadet, backgrounds,

WIDTH = 500
HEIGHT = 500

GRAY = (138,138,138)

cadet = Actor('cadet')
cadet.pos = (WIDTH//3. HEIGHT//3)






#Variables:

#Cadet-> stored as a list, [name, alive(bool), money(nested list with where it is?), frugal score, karma]

#Timeline -> nested list shows where the cadet is at in the story

#Weekends -> Not sure how to make this a variable

#Major events -> Random potential events that could increase money or decrease it by large amounts

#Money management -> 

#General timeline-> opening screen pick character name, select mentors,  make initial financial decisions, 
#first free weekend,  major event 1(good or bad), remake selections, army-navy occurs, winter break plans,
